# Module 13 Challenge - classification-challenge

## Description
This code creates two classification models, logistic regression model and a random forest model, to fit Internet Service Provider (ISP) data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The dataset contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The goal is to improve the email filtering system for its customers.
